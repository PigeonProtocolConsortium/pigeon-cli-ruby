# Pigeon Ruby

A WIP pigeon protocol client.

# How to Use

This is a pre-release skeleton project. There is no gem yet. The gem will be released after we are fully compliant with the spec and have high test coverage stats.

To get started, clone this repo and run `./pigeon-cli` in place of `pigeon`.

Eg: `pigeon identity show` becomes `./pigeon-cli show`.
